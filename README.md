 - are there errors?
 - how the code works?
 - help team to archive the goal
 - more reliable code
 - rewriting required?
 - code matches specs?
 
 ### How to write code
 
 - don't work for more than one hour
 - don't look at more than 400 lines per hour

 - reviewer: be kind to coder, not code
             respect juniorer developers
             avoid "why" questions
             
### Level up your code

- don't just read the code
- visualize the code structure
- do reviews immediately
- imagine your solution before reading theirs
- always approve code unless it has bugs
